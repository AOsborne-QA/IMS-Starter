# Project Title

IMS-Starter is an inventory management interface that has been built with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality in mind that allows a user these options when working with customers, items and orders and interacting with a MySQL database.

This has been built using Java as the main technology, compiled using Maven and tested using JUnit & Mockito.
